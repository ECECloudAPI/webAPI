# Swagger generated server

## Overview
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project. By using the
[OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.  This
is an example of building a swagger-enabled Flask server.

This example uses the 
[Connexion](https://github.com/zalando/connexion) library on top of Flask, and pynamodb

To run the server, you must install python3, install pynamodb, install connexion, install awscli, configure awscli, create tables, and start start the server

To install pynamodb run
```
sudo pip3 install pynamodb
```
To install connexion run
```
sudo pip3 install -U connexion # install Connexion from PyPI
```
To install awscli run
```
pip install awscli
```
To configure awscli run and enter in your access key id and secret access key
```
aws configure
```
To create the tables in your dynamodb on aws run 
```
python3 createTables.py
```
To start the server execute
```
python3 app.py
```
