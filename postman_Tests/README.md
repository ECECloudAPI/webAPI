These test can be used to quickly ensure proper operation of the server you have set up. 
To run the tests you will need to download postman [here][1] 
 
Once postman is installed you will need to import the files included in the postman_tests folder 
into postman.  This is done my opening postman and clicking the import button in the top 
left of the window. 
 
After the environment and test collections are imported you will need to set postmans environment by 
clicking on the manage environment dropdown in the top right of the window and selecting API_test. 
 
The test are then run by opening up the collections panel, selecting the test you want to run and clicking run.
