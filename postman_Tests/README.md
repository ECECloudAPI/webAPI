# Postman Tests

These test can be used to quickly ensure proper operation of the server you have set up.
To run the tests you will need to download postman [here][1]

Once postman is installed you will need to import the files included in the postman_tests folder
into postman.  This is done my opening postman and clicking the inmport button in the top
left of the window.

After the enviroment and test collections are imported you will need to set postmans enviroment by
clicking on the manage enviroment dropdown in the top right of the window and selecting API_test.

The test are then run by opening up the collections panel, selecting the test you want to run and clicking run.
This will open a new window.  If the tests fail, something is wrong with how your server is set up.
